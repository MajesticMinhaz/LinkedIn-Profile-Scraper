### Setting Up a Virtual Environment and Installing Requirements on macOS

#### Introduction
Setting up a virtual environment is a good practice to manage dependencies for your Python projects. This guide will walk you through creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file on macOS.

#### Steps

1. **Open Terminal**
   - Launch the Terminal application on your macOS. You can find it in the Applications folder under Utilities, or you can use Spotlight search (Cmd + Space, then type "Terminal").

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to your project directory. For example:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project
     ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Once you're in your project directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - Activate the virtual environment by running the activation script. Use the following command:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Requirements**
   - With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Verify Installation**
   - After the installation is complete, you can verify that the dependencies were installed correctly by running:
     ```bash
     pip list
     ```
   - This will display a list of installed packages, including the ones from the `requirements.txt` file.

#### Conclusion
You have now successfully set up a virtual environment and installed dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file on macOS. This helps ensure that your project's dependencies are isolated and manageable.



### Insert Existing Dataset to the Database

To insert an existing dataset from an Excel file into your database, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Python Script
You'll use a Python script to read the data from the Excel file and insert it into the database. Let's assume the script is named `insert_data_from_excel_to_db.py`.

#### Step 2: Execute the Script
Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located using the command line. Then, execute the script by running the following command:
```commandline
python3 insert_data_from_excel_to_db.py
```

### Running `linkedin_profile_scraper.py` to Scrape Profiles

To execute the `linkedin_profile_scraper.py` script and initiate the profile scraping process, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `linkedin_profile_scraper.py` file is located.

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the following command in the terminal to run the script:

    ```commandline
    python3 linkedin_profile_scraper.py
    ```

3. **Scraping Process:** Upon execution, the script will start scraping LinkedIn profiles automatically. It may open a browser window to access the LinkedIn profiles and extract the required information.

4. **Automated Scraping:** Don't be alarmed if a browser window opens automatically during the scraping process. This is expected behavior as the script accesses the LinkedIn profiles for scraping.

5. **Completion:** Once the scraping process is complete, the script will automatically gather the necessary data from the profiles and store it as per the defined logic.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly execute the `linkedin_profile_scraper.py` script and initiate the automatic scraping of LinkedIn profiles.


## Example Output Excel(.xlsx) File

Here's an example of how the output Excel file containing scraped LinkedIn profile data might look like:

| PROFILE URL                                      | FIRST NAME | LAST NAME | COMPANY NAME | JOB TITLE |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe/             | John       | Doe       | Example Inc. | CEO       |
| https://www.linkedin.com/in/janesmith/           | Jane       | Smith     | ABC Corp.    | CFO       |
| https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicejohnson/        | Alice      | Johnson   | XYZ Ltd.     | CTO       |

This Excel file contains the scraped data from LinkedIn profiles, including the profile URL, first name, last name, company name, and job title.
